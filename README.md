*******************
*  GEOMETRY       *
*******************

The detector is composed of

(1) 3 planes of ALPIDE tracker (with mechanical supports);

(2) 2 planes of plastic scintillators, each segmented in 5 bars perpendicularly allineated;

(3) a calorimeter of 11 plastic scintillator planes;

(4) 2 planes of LYSO crystal, each segmented in 3 bars perpendicularly allineated;

(5) a veto system composed by plastic scintillator planes surrounds the calorimeter and the crystals.

The simulation includes also the satellite thermal blanket and the box window in front of the tracker.

The geometry is instantiated in HEPD2MCDetectorConstruction class; there is the possibility of modify geometry via the G4 build-in commands (HEPD2MCDetectorMessenger class); the geometry parameters are listed in include/HEPD2MCDetConst.hh.


*******************
*  PHYSICS LIST   *
*******************

The physics lists used in the simulation are instantiated in HEPD2MCPhysicsList class.
They are:

(1)  Electromagnetic processes: gamma conversion, Compton scattering and photoelectric effect for gammas; multiple scattering, ionisation and Bremsstrahlung for electrons, positrons and muons; annihilation for positrons; pair production for muons;

(2)  Elastic hadronic model: G4HadronElasticPhysics and G4IonElasticPhysics;

(3)  Inelastic hadronic model: G4HadronPhysicsShielding and G4IonQMDPhysics;

(4)  Optical physics: Cerenkov, scintillation, absorption, Rayleigh and Mie scattering, optical buondary processes, Birks saturation.


************************
*  PRIMARY GENERATOR   *
************************

It is possible to set the particle features of the primary generator in HEPD2MCPrimaryGeneratorAction class or via the G4 build-in commands (HEPD2MCPrimaryGeneratorMessenger class).
The following commands are available:

(1) /HEPD02/ActivateOptics <bool> enables or disables the scintillating materials in the detector (it only works in vis mode);

(2) /HEPD02/primary/particle <string> sets the particle type to be generated;

(3) /HEPD02/primary/energy <double> <string> sets the value and unit of measure of the particle fixed energy to be generated;

(4) /HEPD02/primary/powenergy <double> <double> <string> <int> sets the minimum and maximum value, the unit of measure and the spetral index of the particle energy spectrum to be generated;

(5) /HEPD02/primary/point <double> <double> <double> <string> (fixed point with fixed direction) sets the X, Y and Z coordinates and unit of measure of the particle point to be generated;

(6) /HEPD02/primary/planewave <double> <double> <double> <string> <double> <double> <string> (random point from a plane rectangle with fixed direction) sets the X and Y maximum coordinates, Z coordinate and unit of measure of the plane, the theta and phi angle and unit of measure of the particle position and direction to be generated;

(7) /HEPD02/primary/random <double> <double> <double> <string> (random point from a plane rectangle with random direction) sets the X and Y coordinates, Z coordinate and unit of measure of the plane of the particle to be generated;
